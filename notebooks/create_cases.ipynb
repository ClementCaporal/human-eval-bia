    "# Creating test cases\n",
    "This notebook takes a folder of notebooks and turns them into a jsonl file in the format human_eval expects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks have to have the following format:\n",
    "* Within one cell there must be a function that solves a specific [bio-image analysis] task.\n",
    "* This function must have a meaningful docstring between \"\"\" and \"\"\". It must be so meaningful that a language model could possibly write the entire function.\n",
    "* There must be another code cell that starts with `def check(candiate):` and contains test code to test the generated code.\n",
    "* The text code must use `assert` statements and call the `candidate` function. E.g. if a given function to test is `sum`, then a valid test for `sum` would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def check(candidate):\n",
    "    assert candidate(3, 4) == 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "* A third python code cell in the notebook must call the `check` function with your custom function, e.g. like this, to prove that the code you provided works with the tests you wrote:\n",
    "```\n",
    "check(sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Optional: You can add as many markdown cells as you like to explain the test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how it works\n",
    "* From the cell with the function definition all code above the docstring, including the docstring, will be stored as prompt. Many prompts from many notebooks will be collected in one `jsonl` file. This notebook does that.\n",
    "* Given language models will be asked to complete the code by adding python code below which does what the docstring claims.\n",
    "* Afterwards, the generated code examples will be executed and the tests will be run to see if the results were correct."
