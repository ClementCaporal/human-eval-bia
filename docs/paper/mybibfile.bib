    abstract = {scikit-image is an image processing library that implements
                algorithms and utilities for use in research, education and
                industry applications. It is released under the liberal
                Modified BSD open source license, provides a well-documented
                API in the Python programming language, and is developed by
                an active, international team of collaborators. In this paper
                we highlight the advantages of open source to achieve the
                goals of the scikit-image library, and we showcase several
                real-world image processing applications that use scikit-image.
