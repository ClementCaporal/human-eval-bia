If it is an image, it adds its full path (using `join`) to a list called `image_files`, which is returned at the end of the function.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input `folder_location` is valid and refers to an existing folder. It also does not check for hidden files or subdirectories in the given folder, so it might miss some image files if those exist."}

Define the `workflow_segmentation_measurement_summary` function with a parameter `image`. Within this function, we'll implement our workflow:\n\n* Firstly, we'll apply thresholding on the input image using `cv2.threshold()`. We use the `THRESH_OTSU` flag for automatic threshold selection.

We can do this by iterating through the `segments` array and calculating the area of each labeled blob using `cv2.contourArea()`. We will store these areas in a list:\n\n\t```python\nareas = [] # Create an empty list to hold the areas of each segmented object\n# Iterate over all connected components (except background)\nfor label_index in range(1, num_labels):\n    # Get a mask corresponding to a specific labeled component\n    seg_mask = np.array((segments == label_index), dtype=np.uint8) * 255\n    # Find contours (boundary points) of the segmented component\n    cnts, _ = cv2.findContours(seg_mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\n    # Calculate the area for each contour (component)\n    areas.append(cv2.contourArea(cnts[0])) \n\t```\n* Finally, we'll compute the mean area and return it:\n\n\t```python\n# Compute the average of all areas\nmean_area = np.mean(areas)\n# Return the mean area\nreturn mean_area\n```\nNow, our complete function looks like this:\n\n```python\ndef workflow_segmentation_measurement_summary(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements a workflow consisting of these steps:\n    1. threshold intensity input image using Otsu's method\n    2. label connected components\n    3. measure area of the labeled objects\n    4. determine mean area of all objects\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Apply otsu threshold to image\n    thresh = cv2.threshold(image, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]\n\n    # Counting component using cv2.connectedComponents()\n    output = cv2.connectedComponents(thresh)\n    # Get total number of labels (objects)\n    num_labels = output[0]\n    # Get segmented image (labeled)\n    segments = output[1]\n\n    areas = []  # Create an empty list to hold the areas of each segmented object\n\n    # Iterate over all connected components (except background)\n    for label_index in range(1, num_labels):\n        # Get a mask corresponding to a specific labeled component\n        seg_mask = np.array((segments == label_index), dtype=np.uint8) * 255\n        # Find contours (boundary points) of the segmented component\n        cnts, _ = cv2.findContours(seg_mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\n        # Calculate the area for each contour (component)\n        areas.append(cv2.contourArea(cnts[0])) \n    \n    # Compute the average of all areas\n    mean_area = np.mean(areas)\n    # Return the mean area\n    return mean_area\n```\nThis function will take a grayscale input image and perform segmentation using Otsu's thresholding and connected components labeling.

It first calculates a threshold value based on the maximum intensity of the image by dividing it by 2. Then, we use this threshold to segment objects in the image using scikit-image's `threshold_otsu()` function.\n*   The segmented binary image is labeled with connected components using SciPy's `ndimage` library's `label()` function, and the resulting labels are stored in a variable called `labeled_image`.\n*   We use scikit-image's `regionprops()` function to calculate region properties such as area, perimeter, mean intensity, minor and major axis for each labeled object. These measurements are stored in a list of numpy arrays (one array per property).\n*   We create a Pandas dataframe (`df`) with the measured properties, where each property is assigned to its own column.\n*   To create UMAP vectors from the measurements, we use `umap` library's `UMAP()` function. The data points are transformed into two-dimensional representation, and the resulting embedding is stored in a numpy array (`embedding`).\n*   We add the UMAP vectors as columns (`umap0` and `umap1`) to the dataframe using Pandas' column assignment method and return the modified dataframe containing all measurements and corresponding UMAP vectors."}

Then, write the actual function definition that will do the work of loading the image, converting it to grayscale, finding its intensity values, calculating the average, and returning it.

Import the `Image` library from PIL. This allows us to load and manipulate images in our Python script. We also import numpy for working with arrays.\n2. We define a function called `crop_quarter_image`, which takes as input an image file (or path).\n3. Inside the function, we first open the input image using the `Image` module from PIL. This gives us access to functions like crop and resize for this particular image.\n4. We then obtain the width and height of the original image by calling `.size` on the Image object.\n5. Next, we calculate the dimensions (width and height) of the quarter-sized image we want to get as an output. This can be done by simply dividing each dimension by 2 (using integer division `//`).\n6. Finally, we crop out the first half of the image using `img.crop()`. We specify the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corners of the cropped rectangle in the function arguments `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

If the pixel does not touch any border, assign its value to the new array at the corresponding position.\n4. After iterating through all pixels in `label_image`, return the new numpy array.\n\nTo implement this plan, we can use `numpy` for working with arrays and `scipy`'s `ndimage` module for neighborhood checking:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage as ndi\n\ndef remove_labels_on_edges(label_image):\n    \"\"\"Remove all objects that touch the image border.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    label_image : array of int or bool\n        The labeled binary mask.

Define a function - Next, we need to define a function called subtract_background_tophat that takes two parameters image and radius with a default value of 1 for radius. This function will apply top-hat filtering on the image while considering the given radius.\n3. Initialize a new variable called structuring element - To perform top-hat filtering, we need to create a structuring element which is basically a shape or pattern that defines how close each pixel should be in order to be considered as part of the same region during the segmentation process. We can use the disk function from ndimage to create such a structuring element with a given radius:\n```python\nselem = ndimage.generate_binary_structure(2,1)\nstruct = np.zeros((radius, radius))  \nstruct[1:-1,1] = 1  \nstruct[1,1:-1] = 1  \nstructuring_element = struct+ selem```\n4.

The result is a 2-dimensional numpy array with dimensions `(image_width, image_height)`. Finally, we convert it to a Python list using `.tolist()` and return it as our final output.\n\nNote that this function only works for RGB images with three channels. If you need to perform summed intensity projection on images with different numbers of color channels, you'll need to modify the code accordingly."}

Import the libraries we will use in our code for this exercise. We will import `skimage`, as well as its sub-packages `color` and `segmentation`. We also need to import the `numpy` library to work with arrays and matrices:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skimage import color, segmentation\n```\n2. Then, we define a function that takes in an RGB image and performs the necessary processing steps to apply watershed segmentation and calculate the sum of areas for objects that touch the border:\n```python\ndef workflow_watershed_segmentation_correction_measurement(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements a workflow consisting of these steps:\n    * blurs the image a bit\n    * detect local minima in the blurred image\n    * apply watershed segmentation flooding the blurred image from the \n      detected minima to retrieve a label image\n    * remove all objects which touch the image border\n    * measure the area of all remaining objects together\n    \"\"\"\n```\n3. Next, we use `skimage`'s `gaussian_filter` function to apply a Gaussian blur to the input RGB image with a sigma value of 2:\n```python\nblurred_image = filters.gaussian(image, sigma=2)\n```\n4. Then, we detect local minima in the blurred image using `skimage`'s `peak_local_max` function and set a threshold to ensure we only consider peaks with a minimum value of 0.1:\n```python\nminima = feature.peak_local_max(blurred_image, indices=False, exclude_border=True, threshold_rel=0.1)\n```\n5. Next, we apply the `watershed` segmentation algorithm from `skimage` to generate a label image of connected regions:\n```python\nlabel = segmentation.watershed(blurred_image, minima)\n```\n6. Then, we use `find_boundaries` function from `skimage`'s `segmentation` module to create a binary mask of the boundaries in the label image:\n```python\nboundary_mask = segmentation.find_boundaries(label).astype('uint8')\n```\n7. To remove all objects that touch the image border, we multiply the label image with the inverted boundary mask to set the labels for objects at the border to 0:\n```python\ncorrected_label = np.multiply(label, -boundary_mask) + label\n```\n8. Finally, we calculate the area of each individual object in the corrected label image using `regionprops` function from `skimage`'s `measure` module and sum up their areas:\n```python\nsummed_area = 0\nfor region in measure.regionprops(corrected_label):\n    summed_area += region.area\n```\n9.

I will import numpy, pandas and umap-learn to work on numerical datasets using unsupervised machine learning algorithms.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom umap import UMAP\n```\nIn order to make a function that works specifically with dataframes we must start by creating the dataframe itself, followed by applying the UMAP algorithm to each of its columns. To do this I will need to use a loop to iterate through all of the dataframe's rows and columns. This can be done using the dataframe's `shape` method which returns the number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n```python\ndef create_umap(dataframe):\n    # Find the dimensions (rows and cols) of the input DataFrame\n    n_rows, n_cols = dataframe.shape\n    \n    # Create a list to store UMAP values\n    umaps = []\n    \n    for col in range(n_cols):  # Iterate through all columns\n        col_data = dataframe[col].to_numpy()  # Extract column data as NumPy array\n        \n        if np.issubdtype(col_data.dtype, np.number):  # Check if the column contains numeric data\n            reducer = UMAP()  # Create UMAP object\n            umap_values = reducer.fit_transform(col_data)  # Apply UMAP to generate 2D coordinates\n        else:\n            print(\"UMAP cannot be applied on non-numeric column:\", dataframe.columns[i])\n            continue\n            \n        umaps.append((umap_values[:,0], umap_values[:,1]))  # Store UMAP values for this column\n        \n    return umaps\n```\nIn the function `create_umap`, first I find out how many rows and columns are in the dataframe using its `shape` method. Then, I create a list called `umaps` to store UMAP coordinates for each column. Finally, I iterate through all of the columns and use the loop variable `col` as an index to extract the data from each column as a NumPy array using `.to_numpy()`.\n```python\ndef create_umap(dataframe):\n    # Find the dimensions (rows and cols) of the input DataFrame\n    n_rows, n_cols = dataframe.shape\n    \n    # Create a list to store UMAP values\n    umaps = []\n    \n    for col in range(n_cols):  # Iterate through all columns\n        col_data = dataframe[col].to_numpy()  # Extract column data as NumPy array\n        \n        if np.issubdtype(col_data.dtype, np.number):  # Check if the column contains numeric data\n            reducer = UMAP()  # Create UMAP object\n            umap_values = reducer.fit_transform(col_data)  # Apply UMAP to generate 2D coordinates\n        else:\n            print(\"UMAP cannot be applied on non-numeric column:\", dataframe.columns[i])\n            continue\n            \n        umaps.append((umap_values[:,0], umap_values[:,1]))  # Store UMAP values for this column\n        \n    return umaps\n```\nIf the data type of each column is numeric, I create a UMAP object and use `fit_transform` to apply the algorithm. This generates 2D coordinates for each point in the dataset. If the data is non-numeric, I print an error message indicating which column cannot be processed with UMAP and move on to the next one. Finally, I append each pair of x and y coordinates to `umaps`.\n```python\ndef create_umap(dataframe):\n    # Find the dimensions (rows and cols) of the input DataFrame\n    n_rows, n_cols = dataframe.shape\n    \n    # Create a list to store UMAP values\n    umaps = []\n    \n    for col in range(n_cols):  # Iterate through all columns\n        col_data = dataframe[col].to_numpy()  # Extract column data as NumPy array\n        \n        if np.issubdtype(col_data.dtype, np.number):  # Check if the column contains numeric data\n            reducer = UMAP()  # Create UMAP object\n            umap_values = reducer.fit_transform(col_data)  # Apply UMAP to generate 2D coordinates\n        else:\n            print(\"UMAP cannot be applied on non-numeric column:\", dataframe.columns[i])\n            continue\n            \n        umaps.append((umap_values[:,0], umap_values[:,1]))  # Store UMAP values for this column\n        \n    return umaps\n```\nThe function returns the list of `umaps`. Each element in the list is a tuple containing two arrays: one for x-coordinates and another for y-coordinates. This data structure makes it easy to access the coordinates for each point in the dataset."}

For each contour, it calculates properties like area, perimeter, and mean intensity using OpenCV's built-in functions. It then appends these measurements to lists and returns them when finished.

Initialize variables - We need to initialize several variables including a mask, an intensity range, a list of pixel positions that are yet to be checked, and the current seed position.\n4. Add seed to mask - As the first step in region growth, we add the starting point to our mask indicating it is part of the segmented region.\n5. Check neighboring pixels - We then check all 8-neighbors of the current pixel (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). If any neighbor falls within the intensity range, we add it to a list of pixels to be checked later. We also update the mask to indicate these pixels are part of the segmented region.\n6.

In case of an exception or invalid input, it handles the error according to your preference."}

The code uses two lists to keep track of the pixels that need to be visited (`queue`) and those that have already been visited (`visited`). The starting point is added to the queue, and then while loop continues until all neighbors are visited. In each iteration, the current pixel's neighboring pixels (up, down, left, and right) are checked for their validity by ensuring they fall within the image boundaries and that they have not been visited yet. If a neighbor is found to be valid and unvisited, it is added to both the queue and the list of visited pixels. After visiting all neighbors, the current pixel is removed from the queue and marked as visited in the `visited` list. Finally, the code creates a mask by marking each visited pixel with a value of 255. This algorithm can be used to segment an image based on similarities between neighboring pixels using this basic implementation of region growing."}

Then, for each label, we use `scipy.ndimage.find_objects` to identify where they are located.

Check if `visited` at [y][x] is 0 (meaning we haven't visited this pixel yet), then:\n\t* Set `visited` at [y][x] to 1, indicating that we've now visited this pixel.\n5. Get the current object ID for the pixel at [y][x] from the label image (`object_id = label_image[y][x]`).\n6. For each neighboring pixel (up, down, left, right), check if it has an ID greater than 0 and if `visited` at that position is not already set to 1:\n\t* If the object ID of this neighbor (`neighbor_id = label_image[y+offset][x+offset]`) is different from the current object's ID, increment the number of touching neighbors for the current object by 1.\n8. Append the number of touching neighbors for the current object to the `touching_neighbors` list.\n9. Return the `touching_neighbors` list.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the label image is a numpy array and that all IDs are greater than 0 (excluding background pixels with ID 0). It also doesn't handle cases where objects touch at corners or diagonally. If you need to handle these cases, you can modify the code to consider more neighboring pixels."}

We will use the function `find_radius` for this.\n3.  **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the calculated circle parameters in the form `(xc, yc, r)`.\n\nThe implementation of these steps is given below:\n```python\ndef fit_circle(list_of_2d_points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements 2D circle fitting using Lagrange Multiplier Method.\n    Input: Collection of 2d points, represented as a list of lists [ [x0,y0], [x1,y1], ... ]  \n    Output: Tuple: xc, yc, radius (xc: float, yc: float, r: float)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate circle center using Lagrange Multiplier method.\n    x_center, y_center = find_circle_center(list_of_2d_points)\n    \n    # Find the radius of the circle as the distance from any point to its center.\n    r = find_radius([x_center, y_center], list_of_2d_points[0])\n    \n    return x_center, y_center, r\n\ndef find_circle_center(list_of_2d_points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the center of the circle using Lagrange Multiplier method.\n    Input: Collection of 2d points, represented as a list of lists [ [x0,y0], [x1,y1], ... ]  \n    Output: xc, yc (xc: float, yc: float)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the sums for each of these variables.\n    sum_x = sum(point[0] for point in list_of_2d_points)\n    sum_y = sum(point[1] for point in list_of_2d_points)\n    sum_xx = sum(point[0]*point[0] for point in list_of_2d_points)\n    sum_yy = sum(point[1]*point[1] for point in list_of_2d_points)\n    sum_xy = sum(point[0]*point[1] for point in list_of_2d_points)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of points.\n    n = len(list_of_2d_points)\n    \n    # Solve the system of equations to find the center coordinates (xc, yc).\n    a11 = 0.5*n\n    b11 = sum_y/len(list_of_2d_points)\n    c11 = -sum_yy/(2*len(list_of_2d_points))\n    \n    a12 = -sum_x/len(list_of_2d_points)\n    b12 = -sum_xy/len(list_of_2d_points)\n    c12 = 0.5*sum_xx/len(list_of_2d_points)\n    \n    xc = (b11+np.sqrt((a11-b11)*(a11-b11)+4*(a12*c11+b11*c12)))/(2*a12)\n    yc = (-sum_x/len(list_of_2d_points)-xc*sum_xy/len(list_of_2d_points))/(sum_y/len(list_of_2d_points))\n    \n    return xc, yc\n\ndef find_radius(center_point, point):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius as the distance from center to given point.\n    Input: Center of circle, any point on the circle  \n    Output: Radius (r)\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.sqrt((point[0] - center_point[0])**2 + (point[1] - center_point[1])**2)\n```\nNow that we have a complete plan of how to solve the problem and written the code for `find_circle_center` and `find_radius`, all you need is to add the import statements on top."}

First, I will import the necessary libraries. Since we're dealing with images, we need to use a library like Pillow or OpenCV for manipulating the image. In this case, we'll use OpenCV since it's easier to rotate an image using the `rotate()` method in OpenCV.\n2. Then, I will define the function `rotate_image_by_90_degrees(image)` that takes an image as input and rotates it by 90 degrees clockwise around its center.\n3. Inside the function body, we'll first read the image using OpenCV's `imread()` method. This will give us a numpy array representation of the image.\n4. Next, we use OpenCV's `rotate()` method with the parameter `ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE` to rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise.\n5. Finally, we'll return the rotated image from the function.\nHere's the complete code:\n```python\nimport cv2\nfrom PIL import Image\n# Step 1: Importing necessary libraries\ndef rotate_image_by_90_degrees(image):\n    # Step 2: Function definition\n    \"\"\"Rotates an image by 90 degrees clockwise around the center of the image.\"\"\"\n    img = cv2.imread(image)                             # Step 3: Reading the image\n    rotated_img = cv2.rotate(img, cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE)   # Step 4: Rotating the image by 90 degrees clockwise\n    return rotated_img                        # Step 5: Returning the rotated image from the function\n```\nOnce you have this completed code, you can use it as a basis for testing and further development."}

Write the function `subsample_image`. This function takes two arguments: `image`, an array representing a grayscale image, and `n`, which indicates how much to subsample the image by (e.g., 2 means skip every other pixel).

Inside the `subsample_image` function, we can use array slicing with a step size of `n`. This will effectively skip every n-th pixel in both dimensions, creating an output image that is smaller by a factor of `1/n`. We also need to calculate and return the new subsampling factor, which should be `n` times larger than the original.\n```python\n    # Subsample the image array using slicing.\n    subsampled_image = image[::n, ::n]\n\n    # Calculate the new subsampling factor based on the input n.\n    new_factor = n * n\n\n    return subsampled_image, new_factor\n```\n4.

We then apply thresholding on the image with the calculated average as the threshold value, and set all pixels above it to white (255) and below it to black (0). This produces a binary image with only two intensity values.\n\nNext, we use `cv2.connectedComponents` to count the number of connected components in the binary image. This returns the total number of objects detected in the image along with their labels. The first element in the tuple represents the number of components, and since this includes the background component, we subtract 1 from it to get the actual object count.\n\nNote that this code assumes the input image is grayscale (single-channel). If the input image is RGB or other multi-channel formats, you'll need to convert it to grayscale before passing it to this function."}

This will leave only those pixels that have a neighboring pixel of opposite sign (i.e., it will remove all interior points and leave only the surface).\n4. **Count non-zero voxels**: We will use `np.count_nonzero()` to count the number of non-zero elements in the eroded volume, which represents the number of surface pixels.\n5. **Calculate the area**: We will multiply the number of surface points by the cube root of 3 (to account for the three spatial dimensions).

Inside this function, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Load the input volume**: We use `load_image()` to load the input binary volume into a numpy array called `image`.\n2. **Perform morphological erosion**: Using scipy's ndimage module, we perform a binary erosion operation on `image`, which results in an eroded image containing only surface voxels. This is accomplished using the `binary_erosion` function with a single iteration.\n3. **Count non-zero voxels**: To estimate the surface area, we count the number of remaining non-zero (surface) pixels in the eroded volume, which we store in `num_surface_pixels`.\n4. **Calculate surface area**: Finally, we multiply `num_surface_pixels` by the cube root of 3 to estimate an initial surface area estimate. We then return this value as the function's output.\n\nNote that this is a rough estimate of the surface area based on cubic voxel units and does not take into account any curvature or irregularities in the object's surface."}

This function returns a new image where each label value in the original image is replaced by the total number of pixels that have this label.\n3. The first step is to create a list of all unique label values in the `label_image`. You can use the `np.unique` function provided by numpy for this purpose. This will give you an array containing all labels, without duplicates.\n4. To count the number of pixels per label, you can use the `np.bincount` function provided by numpy.

The first value will be the count for the first label, the second for the second label, etc.\n5. Now you have an array containing all label values and another array with corresponding pixel counts.

First, you should convert your binary image into an array using numpy.\n 2. Then, you can multiply each pixel in your original image by its corresponding mask value. This will make sure that the output image pixels are set to zero wherever the mask is zero and retain their original values where the mask is one.\n\nHere's an example code that applies this approach:\n```python\nimport numpy as np  # import NumPy for array manipulation\nfrom PIL import Image  # import Pillow library for image processing\n\ndef mask_image(img, binary):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a 2D input image and a 2D binary mask image, then applies the mask to the input image and returns the result.\n    :param img: original 2D grayscale image (PIL Image)\n    :param binary: binary mask image (PIL Image)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Convert images to NumPy arrays\n    np_img = np.array(img, dtype=np.float64)\n    np_binary = np.array(binary, dtype=np.int8)\n    \n    # Apply the binary mask to the original image pixel-wise\n    output = np_img * np_binary[:, :, None]\n    return Image.fromarray(output).convert('RGB')  # Convert back to PIL Image and convert from grayscale to RGB\n```\nIn this code:\n1. The `np.array` function converts both the input image (`img`) and mask image (`binary`) into NumPy arrays. I specify different data types for each array, as appropriate: `dtype=np.float64` for the original image (since we want to maintain its original pixel values) and `dtype=np.int8` for the binary mask (so that we can represent it as a black-and-white image).\n2. We multiply (`*`) the input image array by the mask array. This will zero out pixels in the output where the mask is zero, while preserving their original values where the mask is one.\n3. Finally, we convert the resulting NumPy array back to a PIL Image using `Image.fromarray`. Since our mask was grayscale (2D), and we want to return an RGB image, we also call `convert('RGB')` on the output PIL Image object.\nThis code should fulfill the requirements of your task."}

It returns the results as a pandas DataFrame with columns named `'min_intensity'`, `'mean_intensity'`, and `'max_intensity'`.\n2. `workflow_batch_process_folder_measure_intensity` is the main function that goes through all .tif image files in a specified image folder, and corresponding labels from another labels folder. It loads the images and labels, measures min, mean and max intensity for each label in each image, and returns a single pandas DataFrame with five columns: `'min_intensity'`, `'mean_intensity'`, `'max_intensity'`, `'label'`, and `'filename'` . \n3. `dfs` is a list to store the individual dataframes for each image in the loop. The combined dataframe from all images is returned after the loop ends.\n4. In this code, we assume that the labels have the same name as the corresponding image files with the extension replaced by `.tif`. If your labels are stored in a different way (e.g., in a separate folder), you can adjust the code accordingly. \n5. For simplicity, I've added comments to explain each step in the code. You can remove these comments when you run the code for your own purpose."}

Add the UMAP vectors to the dataframe:\n     ```python\n     measurements['umap0'] = embedded[:, 0]  # Saves the first vector as umap0 column in the dataframe\n     measurements['umap1'] = embedded[:, 1]  # Saves the second vector as umap1 column in the dataframe\n    ```\n9. Return the completed dataframe with all the measurements and UMAP vectors:\n     ```python\n     return measurements\n    ```\n10. Write a function to visualize the UMAP vectors in a scatter plot:\n      ```python\n     def plot_umap(dataframe):  # Function to visually check if the dimensionality reduction was successful\n         plt.scatter(dataframe['umap0'], dataframe['umap1'])\n         plt.xlabel('UMAP0')\n         plt.ylabel('UMAP1')\n         plt.show()\n    ```\n11. Call the `workflow_segment_measure_umap` function:\n     ```python\n     result = workflow_segment_measure_umap(image)  # Runs the workflow and saves the resulting dataframe in 'result' variable\n    ```\n12. Use the `plot_umap` function to visualize the UMAP vectors in a scatter plot:\n     ```python\n     plot_umap(result)\n```\nPlease note that this code is meant as a general guide and may require modifications for your specific application."}

Return the resulting processed image as our final output.\n```python\nimport cv2 # OpenCV library for image processing\nimport numpy as np # NumPy library to handle array data\n\ndef detect_edges(image):\n    \"\"\"Detects and highlights edges in an image.\n    \n    Args:\n        image (ndarray): Image to process.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Edge-detected image with the same shape as input.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    grayscale = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # Convert the image to grayscale (single-channel)\n    \n    edges_img = cv2.Canny(grayscale, 100, 200) # Use Canny edge detector to detect edges\n                                              # The first threshold value is 100 and the second threshold value is 200\n    \n    return edges_img\n```\nIn this code, `cvtColor` converts the input image into grayscale using OpenCV's predefined constants for converting BGR to Gray (BGR2GRAY). The resulting single-channel grayscale image is then processed by Canny edge detection algorithm. This will produce an image with only edges highlighted based on the thresholds provided, in this case 100 and 200. Finally, we return the edge-detected image as our result."}

Return the complete code including my code:\n```python\nimport os  # for file system operations\nfrom PIL import Image  # for working with images\n\ndef list_image_files_in_folder(folder_location):\n    \"\"\"\n    Lists all image files in a folder.\n    Args:\n        folder_location (str): The path to the folder where we want to look for image files.\n    Returns:\n        A list of strings representing the names of images found in the given folder.\n    \"\"\"\n    image_list = []  # Initialize an empty list to store our output\n    for file in os.listdir(folder_location):  # Iterate through each file in the folder\n        try:\n            Image.open(os.path.join(folder_location, file))  # Try to open the file as an image\n            image_list.append(file)  # If it succeeds, add the file to our output list\n        except IOError:\n            pass  # If there was an error opening the file as an image, ignore it and continue with other files\n    return image_list  # Return the final result - a list of images found in the given folder\n```\nThis code is designed to find all image files in a specific directory. We use os.listdir() to iterate through each file in that directory. For each file, we attempt to open it with PIL's Image.open() function. If this succeeds, then we can assume the file is an image and add its name to our list. Finally, we return the resulting list of images found.\n\nPlease note that this code does not differentiate between different types of image files. It will consider all valid images as \"image files\". However, if you need to find only specific types of images (e.g., .jpg, .png), then please modify the function accordingly."}

Return result: Finally, return the mean intensity calculated by the previous step.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef measure_mean_image_intensity(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes an image and returns its mean intensity\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Read image file\n    img = cv2.imread(image)\n    \n    # Calculate mean intensity (excluding alpha channel if present)\n    mean_intensity = np.mean(img[:,:,0:3])  # Note: this is a scalar value\n    \n    return mean_intensity\n```\nIn the function above, I use `cv2.imread()` to read the image file, which returns an array of shape `(height, width, channels)`. Then I calculate the mean intensity by applying NumPy's `mean()` function on the first three channels (excluding alpha channel if present). Finally, I return the calculated mean intensity."}

We also calculate a minor axis length for each object by dividing its perimeter by twice the square root of pi times its area. \n\nNext, we convert the measured properties to a pandas dataframe for easy manipulation. Finally, we create UMAP embeddings using the `UMAP` class from the umap-learn library and add them as columns (`umap0` and `umap1`) in our dataframe. The function returns this augmented dataframe. \n\nTo test this code, you can try running it on a sample image by calling the function with an intensity image as input.
