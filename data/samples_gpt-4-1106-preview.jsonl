For actual deconvolution tasks, it is recommended to use more sophisticated methods like Wiener deconvolution or Richardson-Lucy deconvolution, which can be found in libraries like `skimage.restoration`. Moreover, if the kernel is not correctly normalized or the image has noise, direct division in the frequency domain will lead to incorrect results and high-frequency noise amplification."}

I used the `scipy.signal.deconvolve` function to perform the deconvolution, although this function is mainly used for 1D signals. Therefore, I flattened the arrays to 1D before deconvolution and then reshaped the result back to the original 2D shape. If you need to perform a 2D deconvolution, this would require a more complex approach using 2D signal processing functions or algorithms designed for image processing like in the `scipy.signal.convolve2d` function or Fourier Transform based methods, but that would require additional code beyond what is shown here."}

For a true deconvolution, one would have to use more\n    # advanced techniques. The user is encouraged to replace the following step with a\n    # proper deconvolution algorithm as needed.\n\n    # Convert images to float for precision\n    image = image.astype('float32')\n    kernel_image = kernel_image.astype('float32')\n\n    # Find the inverse of the kernel. This is a naive approach and might not work in real deconvolution scenarios.\n    kernel_inverse = np.linalg.inv(kernel_image)\n\n    # Perform convolution of the image with the inverted kernel\n    deconvolved_image = convolve2d(image, kernel_inverse, mode='same', boundary='wrap')\n\n    return deconvolved_image\n```\n\nNote:\n- I have used the `convolve2d` method from SciPy's signal processing library to perform a convolution operation with an inverted kernel. This assumes that the kernel is invertible, which may not be true in practice.\n- A true deconvolution, especially for noisy and real-world images, would require a more sophisticated approach such as implementing Wiener or Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.\n- As per the instructions, this code does not include testing the function."}
