Read the given image file using an appropriate method that returns array representation with dimensions representing voxel size in Z-Y-X order. For simplicity and without specific libraries like `scikit-image`, we'll use matplotlib to demonstrate the approach, acknowledging that a more suitable library would provide direct access to this information.\n3. Calculate the voxel size by dividing each dimension of the array by the image dimensions if provided (though in our simplified case using matplotlib, we won't directly get these details). Since the real voxel size calculation typically involves metadata which is not inherently part of a simple image read operation without specific libraries or predefined file formats, this step will be more conceptual.\n4. Return a tuple containing the assumed (or calculated) voxel sizes for Z-Y-X if possible, otherwise return `None` to indicate that direct determination is not feasible with standard library calls in Python.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\ndef open_image_read_voxel_size(image_filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads an image file and return its voxel size in Z-Y-X order. (Simplified conceptual approach)\n    Note: This function uses matplotlib for demonstration purposes only. Actual implementation\n    to directly get voxel sizes may vary based on libraries/tools used, typically scikit-image or similar.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Attempting a simple image read using matplotlib\n    try:\n        plt.imread(image_filename)\n        \n        # Note: Directly obtaining the voxel sizes is not possible with this approach; below illustrates conceptual steps\n        # In practice, libraries like scikit-image can provide metadata for such calculation if used\n        return (None, None, None)  # Placeholder return values, actual implementation varies by tool and format\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"matplotlib is not available. Please ensure it's installed.\")\n        return None\n```\n\n*Note: The above code aims to conceptually demonstrate handling an image read operation without directly fetching voxel sizes, which typically requires specialized libraries (like scikit-image) and additional metadata that isn't provided by standard image file formats or their simple readers."}

Import necessary libraries that can help in performing image deconvolution such as NumPy for handling arrays efficiently, SciPy for applying mathematical operations like convolution.\n2. Define the `deconvolve_image` function which takes two parameters: `image`, representing the original image and `kernel_image`, representing the kernel to be used for deconvolution.\n3. Perform Fourier transforms on both images using NumPy's FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) method, as convolution in frequency domain is equivalent to multiplication in time-domain.\n4. Multiply the Fourier transformed image with the inverted Fourier transformed kernel, taking care of division by zero which may happen due to the phase wrapping or zeros in kernel_image; use appropriate handling mechanism like adding a small constant value if necessary.\n5. Apply an inverse FFT to get the deconvolved image from the result obtained in step 4.\n6. Return the resulting image, ensuring that it is appropriately shaped and normalized as needed.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import fftpack\n\ndef deconvolve_image(image, kernel_image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deconvolve an image with a kernel_image using Fourier Transform method and return the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Perform Fast Fourier Transforms on both images\n    fft_image = fftpack.fft2(image)\n    fft_kernel = fftpack.fft2(kernel_image, s=image.shape)\n    \n    # Step 2: Handle division by zero in the frequency domain (add epsilon if necessary)\n    epsilon = 1e-5\n    kernel_inverse_frequency = np.divide(fft_kernel, fftpack.fftfreq(kernel_image.shape[0])**2 + epsilon)\n    \n    # Step 3: Multiply the images in frequency domain and then apply inverse FFT to get the result back in image domain\n    deconvolved_fft = np.multiply(fft_image, kernel_inverse_frequency)\n    deconvolved_image = fftpack.ifft2(deconvolved_fft).real\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the deconvolved image (ensure proper normalization if required)\n    return deconvolved_image\n```"}
