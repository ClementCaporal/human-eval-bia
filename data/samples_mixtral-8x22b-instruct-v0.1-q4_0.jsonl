Firstly, it is important to note that deconvolution in Python can be done using various methods like Wiener filtering or regularized inverse filtering. However, a commonly used approach for image deconvolution is Richardson-Lucy (RL) Deconvolution algorithm which iteratively refines the estimated solution based on maximum likelihood estimation.\n\n2. To implement this, I will use scikit-image library in Python which provides an implementation of the RL algorithm - skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy(). This function takes two mandatory inputs: input image (blurred image) and point spread function(kernel).\n\nHere is a plan to solve this problem:\n1. Import necessary libraries - scipy for mathematical operations, numpy for numerical computations and skimage for image processing tasks especially the richardson_lucy() function from restoration module of skimage library.\n2. Write the deconvolve_image function which will take in two arguments namely 'image' (blurred input image) and 'kernel_image'(point spread function).\n3. Within this function, call the richardson_lucy() function from skimage using blurry image and kernel as inputs to obtain deconvolved or restored image. This method takes number of iterations as optional argument which by default is 5. You can adjust it depending upon your requirement but remember higher the iteration better the result at cost of increased computation time.\n4. Finally, return this restored image from function.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skimage import restoration\nimport scipy.signal as sp_sig\n\ndef decconvolve_image(image, kernel_image):\n    \"\"\"Deconvolves an input 'image' with a given point spread function (PSF) 'kernel_image'.\n\n    Parameters:\n        image - blurred input image to be deconvolved.\n        kernel_image - Point Spread Function or the kernel of the image.\n\n     Returns:\n         restored_image : Numpy array representing the de-blurred/restored image.\n    \"\"\"\n    restored_image = restoration.richardson_lucy(image, kernel_image)\n    return restored_image\n```\nThis function will take as input a blurred image and a point spread function (kernel), apply the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for deconvolution, and then return a numpy array representing the reconstructed image."}

Return the filled-in dictionary after the loop finishes processing all images.\n\nHere is the corresponding code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef workflow_batch_process_folder_count_labels(folder_location):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function goes through all .tif image files in a specified folder,\n    loads the images and count labels each image.\n    It returns a dictionary with filenames and corresponding counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    tif_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(folder_location,\"*.tif\"))\n    label_counts = {}\n\n    for file in tif_files:\n        img = np.array(Image.open(file)) # Load the image using PIL\n        unique, counts = np.unique(img, return_counts=True) # Find unique labels and their frequencies\n        label_counts[os.path.basename(file)] = dict(zip(unique, counts))  # Store filename-count pairs in dictionary\n    return label_counts\n```\nThis code assumes that the images have already been preprocessed such that different objects are represented by unique integers (labels). The number of labels and their sizes can be further processed as per specific requirements."}

Finally, you can add any necessary error handling and return the resulting image after deconvolution.\n\nHere's how you can complete the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import signal\n\ndef deconvolve_image(image, kernel_image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deconvolve an image with a kernel_image and return the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Flatten images into 1D arrays for deconvolution\n    input_signal = image.flatten()\n    filter_kernel = kernel_image.flatten()\n\n    # Perform deconvolution using scipy's deconvolve function\n    try:\n        output, remainder = signal.deconvolve(input_signal, filter_kernel)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        raise Exception(\"Deconvolution error:\" + str(e)) from e\n\n    # Reshape the result back into its original shape and return it\n    return np.reshape(output, image.shape)\n```"}

We will use scikit-image library for its morphological operations on binary images, specifically the `binary_erosion()` function, and also NumPy library to handle array manipulation.\n2. The idea is to first pad the label image with zeros around the border (this makes sure that objects touching the border will be removed), then perform a binary erosion operation which removes all pixels from the edges of shapes in the image. After removing pixels, we remove any labels that are no longer present in the eroded image.\n3. We also have to keep track of which labels were originally along the border and need to be removed after the erosion process. So we will create a list to store these labels before applying erosion operation.\n4. After the binary erosion operation, remaining labels are not touching the image border but they might include some smaller objects that used to touch the border. To remove those small objects, we apply one more morphological operation called 'binary_opening()'. This removes any objects which have a size less than or equal to the given structuring element shape (here I am using a disk shaped structure).\n5. After this process, the original label image will be modified such that all labels touching the border are removed along with small objects created after erosion.\n\nHere's the complete Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage\nfrom skimage import morphology\n\ndef remove_labels_on_edges(label_image):\n    \"\"\"Takes a label image and removes all objects which touch the image border.\"\"\"\n\n    # Padding to make sure objects touching the border will be removed.\n    padded = np.pad(label_image, 1)\n\n    # Create a structuring element for erosion operation.

Inside the function, create a square structuring element using SciPy's morphology module with the given radius. This will be used for performing the closing operation.\n4.

To get the quarter size image, we need to find the middle point of both dimensions (width and height) and crop half from each side along those dimensions.\n3. We will use array slicing to do the cropping since images can be represented in Python using numpy arrays with dimensions: (height, width). The resulting subarray will represent the cropped image.\n4. Return the cropped image as a result of our function.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef crop_quarter_image(image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Crops out the first half image in both dimensions (width and height).\n    The resulting image will be of quarter size compared to the original image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate midpoints for both dimensions\n    height, width = image.shape[:2]\n    mid_height = height // 2\n    mid_width = width // 2\n\n    # Crop half from each side along those dimensions using array slicing\n    cropped_image = image[mid_height:, mid_width:]\n\n    return cropped_image\n```"}

Return the resulting deconvolved image as output.\nHere's the code with these steps:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef deconvolve_image(image, kernel_image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deconvolve an image with a kernel_image and return the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure that input images have same shape and are of float type\n    if not (image.shape == kernel_image.shape and image.dtype == np.float32 and kernel_image.dtype == np.float32):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input images must have the same shape and be of floating-point type.\")\n    # Flip kernel_image horizontally and vertically (i.e., 180 degrees)\n    flipped_kernel = np.flip(np.flip(kernel_image, axis=0), axis=1)\n    # Initialize empty result image of same shape as input images\n    deconvolved_image = np.zeros_like(image)\n    # Calculate padding size for zero-padding input images if necessary\n    pad_width = ((flipped_kernel.shape[0] - 1) // 2, (flipped_kernel.shape[0] + 1) // 2, (flipped_kernel.shape[1] - 1) // 2, (flipped_kernel.shape[1] + 1) // 2)\n    # Pad input images with zeros if necessary\n    padded_image = np.pad(image, pad_width=pad_width, mode='constant')\n    # Iterate over each pixel in deconvolved image and calculate its new value based on the corresponding values in original image and flipped kernel using convolution\n    for i in range(deconvolved_image.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(deconvolved_image.shape[1]):\n            # Extract window of same size as flipped kernel from padded input image (centered at current pixel) and perform element-wise multiplication with flipped kernel\n            window = padded_image[(i - pad_width[0]):(i + pad_width[3]), (j - pad_width[1]):(j + pad_width[2])] * flipped_kernel\n            # Sum up all products in current window and assign to corresponding pixel in deconvolved image\n            deconvolved_image[i, j] = np.sum(window)\n    # Normalize result image by dividing it by sum of all elements in flipped kernel\n    deconvolved_image /= np.sum(flipped_kernel)\n    return deconvolved_image\n```"}

This will create overlapping regions between adjacent labels.\n   - Create an expanded mask by subtracting the original label image from the dilated label image, which will give us only the newly created overlapped regions.\n   - For each pixel in the expanded mask, find the nearest non-zero neighbor (using scipy's distance transform and argmin) to resolve conflicts between adjacent labels. The label assigned to a given pixel is determined by the smallest index of its closest non-zero neighbors in the original label image. This ensures that smaller label indices will not be overwritten by larger ones during expansion.\n5. Assign the newly resolved label values from the expanded mask back into the output array using advanced indexing (np.putmask()).\n6. Return the updated label_image with enlarged labels and no overlaps.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skimage import morphology, measure, segmentation\n\ndef expand_labels_without_overlap(label_image, radius: int = 1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a label_image and enlarges all labels by a given radius, without\n    labels overwriting each other.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create an empty output array with the same shape as input image.\n    out = np.zeros(label_image.shape, dtype=np.int32)\n\n    # Find unique non-zero (non-background) labels in label_image.\n    unique_labels = np.unique(label_image)[1:]  # exclude background label (0).\n\n    for label in unique_labels:\n        # Extract pixels belonging to a given label and their coordinates.\n        coords, _ = np.where(label_image == label)\n\n        # Dilate the extracted pixels using a disk structuring element with specified radius.\n        dilated = morphology.dilation(np.zeros_like(label_image),\n                                      morphology.disk(radius))\n        dilated[coords[:, 0], coords[:, 1]] = label\n\n        # Create a mask representing only the overlapping regions between adjacent labels.\n        expanded_mask = np.where((dilated - label_image) > 0, 1, 0) * (label_image == 0)\n\n        # Find nearest non-zero neighbor for each pixel in the expanded mask.\n        dist = measure.distance_transform_edt(expanded_mask==0)\n        idxs = np.argmin(dist, axis=None)\n        label_indices = segmentation.find_objects(label_image == 1)[0].ravel() + 1\n        nearest_labels = label_indices[idxs]\n\n        # Resolve overlapping regions by assigning the smallest index of closest non-zero neighbors (in original image).\n        np.putmask(out, expanded_mask!=0, nearest_labels)\n\n    return out\n```"}

We can also use a library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for plotting if needed. However, since the function only needs to return the measurements, we won't need any visualization libraries here.\n\nNext, we will define our function `measure_intensity_over_time()`, which takes in a list of images as its argument. Inside this function, we can iterate over each image and calculate its average intensity using `numpy` functions such as `mean()`. We can then store these measurements in a new list that will be returned by the function at the end.\n\nHere is an implementation of the above approach:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef measure_intensity_over_time(image_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a timelapse (list of images), measures the average intensity over time and returns the resulting measurements as list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the intensity measurements\n    intensities = []\n    # Iterate over each image in the input list\n    for img in image_list:\n        # Convert the image from BGR to grayscale using OpenCV\n        gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n        # Calculate the average intensity of the grayscale image and append it to the intensities list\n        intensity = np.mean(gray)\n        intensities.append(intensity)\n    return intensities\n```\nThis implementation assumes that the input images are in BGR format, which is a common color representation used by OpenCV. If your images are in a different format (e.g., RGB), you may need to adjust the code accordingly. Additionally, if you want to measure intensity for specific channels only, you can modify the code to extract those channels and calculate their mean values separately."}

Define a function open_image_return_dimensions() which takes an image file location as argument.\n3. Open the image using Image.open().\n4. Get dimensions by calling size attribute of opened image object.\n5. Return these dimensions from our function as tuple (width, height).\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef open_image_return_dimensions(image_file_location):\n    \"\"\"\n    Opens an image and returns its dimensions\n    \"\"\"\n    with Image.open(image_file_location) as img:\n        return img.size\n```"}

This class has various attributes including 'area' which can be accessed directly to get the surface area of the convex hull. Also, remember that this solution assumes that your 3D point_cloud is a list of points where each point is represented as [x, y, z].\n\nThis function also uses qhull algorithm for calculating convex hull, which is quite efficient and robust in dealing with different types of point distributions. The option `qhull_options='QJ'` ensures that the output always contains all vertices even if they are redundant (which could happen due to numerical errors).\n\nThe complexity of this function depends primarily on the implementation of ConvexHull in scipy, which is based on Qhull library. In general, for n points in d-dimensions, the time complexity is O(n log n) and space complexity is O(dn), but it may vary depending upon different factors including input point distribution and qhull options used."}

This can be done using OpenCV or Pillow libraries, but we will stick with NumPy here for simplicity.\n3. Create an edge mask from the input image to preserve edges during filtering. To do this, compute a Sobel filter response (gradient magnitude) and apply a threshold on it to identify strong edges. This can be done using SciPy's `signal.convolve2d` function for applying 2D convolution operation with the Sobel filters and NumPy for thresholding the gradient magnitudes.\n4. Apply a smoothing filter (e.g., Gaussian) on the input grayscale image but use the previously generated edge mask to preserve edges while removing noise.

Import the numpy library which provides support for arrays and array operations in Python, as image processing involves working with pixel data that can be represented as 2D or 3D arrays (depending on whether we are considering grayscale images or colored ones).\n\n2. In the function `sum_images`, first ensure that both input arguments (image1 and image2) are numpy arrays by converting them if necessary. If they aren't, you can convert them into a compatible format using `numpy.array(input_variable)`.\n\n3. Ensure both images have the same shape, i.e., dimension (height, width), or in case of RGB images (height, width, color_channels). For grayscale images this would be 2D arrays and for colored ones it will be a 3D array where the third dimension is for red, green and blue channels respectively. If they aren't, raise an error message since we can only add pixel values from the same locations on both images.\n\n4. Use numpy's element-wise addition operation to add corresponding pixels of two images together. In Python, this is as simple as `image1 + image2`. Since both input arguments are now numpy arrays and have been checked for consistent dimensions in step 3, this will correctly sum the pixel values from each location across both images.\n\n5. Return the resulting array which contains the sum of corresponding pixels from image1 and image2. If no specific return type is required (like uint8 for unsigned 8-bit integers), then just returning the result as a numpy array should suffice.\n\nHere's what this plan would look like when translated to code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sum_images(image1, image2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sums two images pixel-by-pixel and returns the result\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 2: Ensure both inputs are numpy arrays\n    if not isinstance(image1, np.ndarray) or not isinstance(image2, np.ndarray):\n        raise TypeError(\"Both image1 and image2 must be numpy arrays.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Ensure images have the same shape\n    if image1.shape != image2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Images must have the same dimensions (height, width) or in case of RGB images (height, width, color_channels).\")\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Use numpy's element-wise addition and return result\n    summed_image = image1 + image2\n    return np.clip(summed_image, 0, 255)  # Enforcing upper limit to 255 for valid pixel values (in case of overflow)\n```"}
