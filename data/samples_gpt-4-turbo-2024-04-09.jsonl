Make sure to replace or augment \"radius\" parameter handling based on the detailed requirements on how the radius affects the filtering strength directly within the OpenCV function when needed. Here, I assumed \"radius\" directly controls the strength of the denoising filter, which typically maps to the `h` value in `fastNlMeansDenoisingColored`. Advanced use may need adjustment in the `photo_render` parameters and tuning other parameters like `hForColorComponents` and `templateWindowSize`."}
